# cs224w-webbopekedo-finalproj
A workspace for James Webb, Kelvin Do and Rotimi Opeke to collaborate on their CS224W project. This work should be considered part of the Yelp Academic Challenge and their data should not be utilized unless given prior permission by Yelp!

*~~~~ This should really be a private repository, but we are going to have to settle for now ~~~~~*

# Hey guys!

### Setup:
1. Clone this repository
2. Download the Yelp Dataset from the WeTransfer link that I sent you and put that in the same folder as where you clone this repository
3. Download and install the networkX package that you can find online here https://pypi.python.org/pypi/networkx or with pip!
3. To run what I have so far, type `python yelp_json_parser.py yelp_academic_set.json`
4. To continue building from where I left off, you can reference some of the networkX documentation here http://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/tutorial/tutorial.html
5. Hack away!


*Goes without saying, but try to use as many comments or add to the README to keep everyone in the loop!*
